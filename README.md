# Mouthwash.gg
Mouthwash.gg is an _open source re-implementation_ of the Polus.gg backend, made with [Hindenburg](https://github.com/skeldjs/Hindenburg).

## Install
Mouthwash.gg is still in development for the time being, check back later! (Or contribute!)

## Information
### Why?
After Polus.gg's closure, Mouthwash.gg was created to continue the potential that Polus.gg had, and to continue development in another, open-source form.

### What's the goal?
The goal of Mouthwash.gg is to be a complete replacement for the Polus.gg server, while remaining ([for the most part](#disclaimers)) open source.

Specifically, it hopes to rethink API decisions and remain consistent in order to make gamemode development as easy as possible.

### Is it legitimate?
Mouthwash is supported by the original developers of Polus.gg, it is a completely legitimate software.

### What about submerged?
Unfortunately, as Submerged was developed by another team separate from Polus.gg, Submerged must be removed from all distributions of the Polus.gg client in relation to Mouthwash.gg.

## Legal Things
#### Disclaimers
##### Unfortunately, the development of Mouthwash.gg runs into some shaky legal and moral grounds, so there are a few disclaimers to be aware of.

##### 1. Due to issues regarding how the original mod was distributed, and how it is seen in the eyes of the developers, steam and Innersloth, the client mod source cannot be made open source as this time, although it and its updates will be distributed as freely and as available as possible.

##### 2. The only open source guarantee of Mouthwash is the actual Polus.gg gamemode and role API reimplementation to build gamemodes out of. Personally, I have great respect for retaining the integrity of Mouthwash's open source nature, however I will take the opportunity to make my own gamemodes initially private before open sourcing them at a later date.

##### 3. While completely rewritten from the ground-up and using completely different server software, a substantial part of the development, as well as most art, was made previously by the rest of the Polus.gg developers. For this reason, the asset server (as well as raw asset files) is completely private-source and it should SOLELY be used to communicate with a Mouthwash.gg server.

### Notes
Mouthwash is _very strictly_ available under the [SSPL](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license) license. You hold no right to distribute private modifications of the software (Clause 5), or have any intention to make a revenue from selling the software or any modifications of it (Clause 13). Any code contributed to Mouthwash is automatically agreed to be held under the same license.
